Applying NLP models (FinVADER and FinBERT) to predict stock movements

#My research question was: What is the predictive power of Twitter sentiment on stock price movements of Apple, Amazon and Tesla stocks ?

#I structure the paper as follows: I outline the relationship between tweets and stock movements in the literature. I describe the data, the models I use in this paper and the methodological framework. To answer the research question, I apply state-of-art NLP models â€“ FinBERT and FinVADER - to perform microblogging sentiment analysis on pre-processed tweets. I generate a binary microblogging sentiment (positive or negative) for relevant tweets from September, 2021 to September, 2022. Logistic regression (LR) serves as Machine Learning (ML) classifier with labels up- and downward movement (stock movement direction of the next day). The ML classifier is evaluated against the metrics accuracy and F1-score. Then I present the empirical results and I discuss the results and limitations. Lastly, I conclude by giving a short overview of the thesis and I will answer the research question.
